Music Player using python
-- As the name itself gives us the clear idea about what the system is about. In this Music player system we can load the songs from our 
   device. Also there are various features like we can pause the song, unpause it, and navigate from cureent song to previous or next song.

-- The libraries that we used in making of the system are Tkinter library for the making the window of the application and it also very 
   useful for the GUI application creation.Also the Tkinder widgets are very much useful.Next we use is the Pygame libarary's mixer module
   as it provides different features for playing the song-tracks. We also make use of os library fro fetching the playlist songs from the 
   directory. Pickle module is used for serializing a object so that they can save to a file and load it in program when needed.
